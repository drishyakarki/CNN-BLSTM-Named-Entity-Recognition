# NER From Scratch

In this project, I have implemented NER from scratch. To do so, I have followed this research paper: [Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08308) by Jason P.C. Chiu, Eric Nichols. I have structured the project and seperated the notebook and the scripts.

## Project Highlights
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model implemented using TensorFlow. This model is designed for Named Entity Recognition, a subtask of information extraction that aims to identify named entities (e.g., person names, locations, organizations) in text. It utilizes a combination of character-level and word-level embeddings to achieve high accuracy in NER tasks.

## Getting Started
To run this project on your own, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own projects. Enjoy your NLP journey!
